# TheFatRat-MinGW-fix
A bash script that fixes the MinGW installation problems with TheFatRat.

Give the file executable permissions.
```zsh
sudo chmod +x MinGW.sh
```
Then run it, it doesnt matter where you run it either.
```zsh
sudo ./MinGW.sh
```
After it's done, run TheFatRat's `setup.sh` file again, and it should work for the MinGW part.

Any problems with the script please let me know.
